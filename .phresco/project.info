Autocomplete involves the program predicting a word or phrase that the user wants to type in without the user actually typing it in completely. This feature is effective when it is easy to predict the word being typed based on those already typed, such as when there are a limited number of possible or commonly used words (as is the case with e-mail programs, web browsers, or command line interpreters), or when editing text written in a highly-structured, easy-to-predict language (as in source code editors). Autocomplete speeds up human-computer interactions in environments to which it is well suited. Autocomplete features are often enabled by default, and disabling or defeating them can sometimes be difficult for users to accomplish.","type":"HELP_TEXT"},{"content":"Autocomplete, when added to an input field, enables users to quickly find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type.","type":"DESCRIPTION"}],"versions":[{"documentsid":0,"version":"1.0","url":"/modules/tech-php/files/mod_auto_complete_search_1.0/1.0/mod_auto_complete_search_1.0-1.0.zip","modulesid":0}],"imageURL":"images/tech-php/Auto-Complete-search.png"},{"id":"mod_commenting_system._1.0","groupId":"Commenting-system.png","artifactId":"Commenting-system.png","name":"Commenting system.","core":false,"required":false,"docs":[{"content":"Comments in PHP are similar to comments that are used in HTML.
